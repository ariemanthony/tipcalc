This is my iOS pre-work app. This app provides suggested tip percentages for the user. The three options are 18, 20 and 22%.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 Required: User can enter numbers in the bill amount field and have it reflect the total including tip percentage selected.
 Required: User can select other tip percentages and see the total update without needed to re-enter the amount in the text field above
 Required: User can tap anywhere on the screen after entering an amount and the keyboard will disappear
 Optional: changed background color
 Optional: Aligned objects to the top of the screen so everything is viewable once the keyboard appears
 Optional: Increased text to 17pt and decreased tip amount to 16pt so the total has more focus.
 Optional: Increased total amount to 30pt and changed the color to green so it's the main focus.
